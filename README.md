# Flask directory gallery

Very simple gallery to display all images from a directory.  
I'm currently running this on a raspberry pi, to take some timelapse pictures, 
and have a easy way to look at them.

It's python3 based, and uses Flask and Pillow as dependencies. You can just 
use the provided `requirements.txt` to create your virtual environment.
